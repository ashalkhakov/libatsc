# atslibs: what's this?

This is a repository for one-file ATS libraries for programming in C
style:

* work with C idioms directly
* use extensive static typing for safety
* minimal or no reliance on GC

* portions of ATS1/ATS2 code: GPLv3
  * by "portions" I mean some static definitions
* my own code: [MIT](./LICENSE)

# Installing (via `gitman`)

2. assuming that you have already setup your `.gitman.yml`, add this
   repository to the configuration (manually for now)

   package
